# BESS_Revenue_Scenarios

## Phase 1. Imbalance Forecasting - Gaussian Sampling

30/04/2025 - This project contains the data as well as the models to obtain adjusted BESS long-term revenue forecasts. The output of the forecasts is to be used in the Emmett Green Finance Business Case Deep Uncertainty Tool. The relevant output is the file in the "forecast_output" directory. The model takes as an input the EMS monthly output !excel! file which should placed in the "ems_output" folder. For good performance, the revenues should span at least 4 years (2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024).
